# Student Enrollment Form

## Description
This project is a comprehensive web-based **Student Enrollment Form** designed to facilitate the entry, validation, and storage of student data using **JsonPowerDB (JPDB)**. It provides robust functionalities such as saving, updating, and resetting student information in a secure and efficient manner. The project integrates seamlessly with **JsonPowerDB** for rapid data management, making it ideal for educational institutions seeking a streamlined enrollment process.

## Benefits of Using JsonPowerDB
- **High Performance**: JsonPowerDB is a high-performance NoSQL database that enables fast data storage and retrieval with minimal overhead.
- **RESTful API**: JPDB provides a RESTful API interface, allowing easy integration with web applications like this enrollment form.
- **JSON Data Format**: JPDB supports storing data in the JSON format, making it perfect for handling both structured and semi-structured data.
- **Security**: JsonPowerDB ensures data integrity and security with multiple layers of protection, making it reliable for sensitive data storage.

## Release History
- **Version 1.0.0**: Initial release of the **Student Enrollment Form** with integration into JsonPowerDB, offering full CRUD functionalities (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Illustrations
Below are screenshots or illustrations of the form layouts and interactions in the project:
- **Student Enrollment Form**: Showcases input fields for student details like ID, Name, Date of Birth, etc.
- **Employee Form**: Demonstrates form layout to capture and validate employee information.
  
(*Include relevant screenshots here for better understanding.*)

## Scope of Functionalities
The project offers the following core functionalities:
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that all mandatory fields (like Student ID, Employee ID, etc.) are filled out correctly before data submission. It includes checks for valid email addresses, empty fields, and proper formatting.
- **Save Data**: Captures form data and saves it to the JsonPowerDB database using its RESTful API.
- **Update Data**: Allows users to update existing records in the database. When an ID is provided, it checks for existing records and allows modifications.
- **Reset Form**: Provides a convenient button to reset the form fields to their initial empty state, allowing users to clear their input easily.

## Examples of Use
The system can be used in various scenarios:
1. **New Student Enrollments**: Educational institutions can use the form to enroll new students into their system by capturing essential details such as ID, name, birth date, address, and enrollment date.
2. **Updating Student Information**: In case of changes (like address updates or class assignments), administrators can retrieve and update student records quickly.
3. **Employee Data Management**: Similarly, institutions can maintain employee data using the Employee Form.

## Project Status
The project is currently in **active development**. The following enhancements are being worked on:
- Additional input validation features (e.g., dynamic validation on field focus-out).
- Improved user interface with better success/error handling messages.
- Bug fixes and optimizations for faster API responses.
  
Future releases will include new features such as:
- Enhanced security for API calls.
- Exporting student/employee data to a CSV or Excel format.

## Sources
This project relies on several external libraries and resources:
- **[JsonPowerDB Documentation](https://login2explore.com/jpdb/docs.html)**: For understanding the JsonPowerDB functions and integration.
- **[Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/)**: Used to build a responsive and modern user interface.
- **[JsonPowerDB Functions](https://login2explore.com/jpdb/resources/js/0.0.4/jpdb-commons.js)**: Official JavaScript library for interacting with JsonPowerDB.

### employeeForm.html
The `employeeForm.html` file captures employee details such as:
- Employee ID
- Employee Name
- Email
It includes basic validation to ensure that no empty fields are submitted and provides a save button to send data to JsonPowerDB via the REST API.

Key features:
- **Validation**: Checks if all fields are filled.
- **Save Button**: Triggers the submission of form data to the JsonPowerDB database.
- **Form Reset**: Clears all inputs after saving.

### enrollmentForm.html
In `enrollmentForm.html`, we designed a form specifically for student enrollment. It captures the following student details:
- Roll No
- Full Name
- Class
- Birth Date
- Address
- Enrollment Date

Key features:
- **Save**: Saves new student information to JsonPowerDB.
- **Update**: Updates existing student information when Roll No is matched.
- **Reset**: Clears all fields, allowing fresh input.

### practice.html
`practice.html` serves as the homepage of the application. It provides navigation links to other sections of the project (e.g., the Employee Form, Enrollment Form). Bootstrap is used extensively to create a clean and responsive layout.

Key features:
- **Navigation**: Provides a starting point for navigating the project’s forms and functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap enables the page to be mobile-friendly and adaptable to different screen sizes.

### save.html
The `save.html` file contains the logic for saving data from both the employee and student forms to JsonPowerDB. It includes JavaScript code that:
- Validates the input data.
- Sends a PUT request to the database.
- Handles the responses from the API (success/error).
- Resets the form after a successful submission.

Key features:
- **AJAX Integration**: Sends data to the database asynchronously using jQuery’s AJAX functionality.
- **PUT Request**: Data is sent to JsonPowerDB using a RESTful PUT request.
- **Form Handling**: Resets the form and shows alert messages for successful or failed operations.
